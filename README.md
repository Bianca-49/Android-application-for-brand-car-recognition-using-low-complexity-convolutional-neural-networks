# Android-application-for-brand-car-recognition-using-low-complexity-convolutional-neural-networks

A relevant automotive recognition database, CompCars, was identified. Various low-complexity deep-learning CNN models (EfficientNet, DenseNet, Inception-V3, ResNet, SimpleCNN) were implemented and optimized in Python using Keras and TensorFlow Lite for recognition accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency. Kaggle accelerators improved training speed. The optimized models were saved in TFLite format for an Android app, which includes a user interface for car brand recognition from new images.
